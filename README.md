Keygen is a tool for creating keys to be used with Taquito Integration tests

# Context:
In Taquito, we cannot run all integration tests using a single account. There are two reasons for this:

1. Some tests require the account to not be `reveal`ed.
1. In Tezos, each account can have only one `ManagerOperation` in each block. Because of that, if we need to run multiple integration tests t once, we should run them using different accounts.
